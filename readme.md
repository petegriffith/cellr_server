## Project Status

The backend API is nearly complete, with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests for the wines and encounters table, and a basic users endpoint. The next big step in the backend is to figure out auth.

## Instillation and setup instructions
Fork, clone, and then

- To install dependancies:

    `npm install`

- To compile and run the Node server:

    `npm run back`

- To set tsc to watch mode if you'd like to make changes to the back end in realtime:

    `tsc -w`

## Reflection

So far, this has been an excellent exercise in re-familiarizing myself with working with REST API design!
